# Job Recommendation Service

This project is a backend service built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB that provides job recommendations based on a user's profile. It matches user preferences with job postings stored in the database, leveraging a recommendation algorithm to deliver personalized job suggestions.

# Features
• RESTful API: A single API endpoint that accepts user profile data and returns recommended job postings.
• Flexible Recommendation Logic: Matches job postings to user profiles based on skills, experience level, job type, and location preferences.
• Error Handling: Includes error handling for invalid requests and database operations.
• Database: Uses MongoDB to store job data and fetch relevant job postings.

# Technologies Used
• Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side programming.
• Express: Web framework for building the RESTful API.
• MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing job data.
• Mongoose: Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

# Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/riishabhraj/job-recommendation-api
cd job-recommendation-api
```

# Install dependencies:

``` bash
npm install
```

# Configure MongoDB:

Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running.
Create a .env file in the project root directory and specify your MongoDB URI:
env

``` bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/jobRecommendationDB
```

# Start the server:

``` bash
npm start
```

The server should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

# API Usage
The following endpoint is available:

POST /api/recommendations
Description: Provides job recommendations based on the user's profile.

Request Body: JSON containing user profile information.

Example:

``` JSON
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "skills": ["JavaScript", "Node.js", "React"],
  "experience_level": "Intermediate",
  "preferences": {
    "desired_roles": ["Software Engineer", "Full Stack Developer"],
    "locations": ["San Francisco", "Remote"],
    "job_type": "Full-Time"
  }
}
```

Response: JSON array of recommended jobs or a message indicating no matching jobs were found.

Example:

``` json
[
  {
    "job_title": "Full Stack Developer",
    "company": "Startup Hub",
    "location": "San Francisco",
    "job_type": "Full-Time",
    "required_skills": ["JavaScript", "Node.js", "React"],
    "experience_level": "Intermediate"
  },
  {
    "job_title": "Software Engineer",
    "company": "Tech Solutions Inc.",
    "location": "Remote",
    "job_type": "Full-Time",
    "required_skills": ["JavaScript", "Node.js"],
    "experience_level": "Intermediate"
  }
]
```
Error Response:

``` json
{
  "message": "No matching jobs found based on the given profile."
}
```

# Recommendation Logic
The recommendation algorithm matches jobs with the user profile based on the following criteria:

Skills: Jobs with skills matching those in the user profile are prioritized. Each matching skill adds to the match score.
Experience Level: If the job requires the same experience level as the user's, the match score is increased.
Location: Jobs in the user's preferred locations, including remote positions, receive higher priority.
Job Type: Jobs with the same job type as the user's preference are preferred.
The service calculates a match score for each job posting:

+2 points for each matching skill
+3 points for an experience level match
+2 points for a location match
+1 point for a job type match
Jobs that meet a minimum score threshold are returned in descending order of relevance.

Directory Structure
The project follows a modular structure for better organization:

``` bash

└── README.md                    # Documentation
```

# Error Handling
The service implements error handling for:

• Invalid Requests: Returns a 400 Bad Request response for missing or malformed user profile data.
• Database Errors: Logs errors and returns a 500 Internal Server Error response if there are issues connecting to or querying the database.
• No Matches Found: If no jobs match the user profile, the service responds with a friendly message indicating no recommendations are available.

# Future Enhancements
Potential future improvements to the service:

• Advanced Matching: Implement a machine learning model to improve recommendation quality.
• User Feedback: Allow users to rate job recommendations to improve future suggestions.
• Pagination: Add pagination to the API response to handle larger datasets.
